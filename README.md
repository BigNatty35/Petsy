# RegrEtsy

[Live Site](https://theregretsy.herokuapp.com/#/)


RegrEtsy is a fully functional single page fullstack application inspired by the website "Etsy". As Etsy allows users to buy and sell handmade or vintage items and supplies, RegrEtsy is a place you go to buy things you'll most likely regret.

Implementing an MVC architecture, I used React and Redux on the frontend with Ruby on Rails on the backend, utilizing PostgreSQL as my datbase.
